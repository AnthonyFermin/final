# Access Code 2.1 final assessment &mdash; laptop coding section

In this section, you will complete the implementation of several small methods,
classes, or programs that we provide you with. Each question is contained
in a separate package under the `src/` directory of each repository. Each 
package contains a `README.md` describing the problem and specifying what you
must do to solve it.

Very simple tests are provided with some of the problems. These tests are _not_
comprehensive; passing these tests does not guarantee that your solution is
correct. Your solution must satisfy the problem as described, and otherwise
behave reasonably. You may add additional tests if you find that helpful.

For each question, do the following:

1. Read and understand the README.
2. Examine the provided code, especially the parts marked "TODO".
3. Implement the problem.

Finally, check your solution for the following:

- The code compiles (ideally, without warnings).
- If tests are provided, they pass.
- Your code is organized and formatted reasonably.
- Your variables, methods, and attributes are named reasonably.
- You follow good Java coding practice regarding,
  - member access (`public` or `private`)
  - static methods and attributes
