# Radio Button Groups

In a user interface, a "radio button group" is a group of buttons in which
exactly one button may be selected at a time. (If you press one button, the
other button that is currently selected "pops up" like buttons on an 
old-fashioned radio.)

Your task is to implement a class that models this behavior. The class 
represents a group of buttons; the number of buttons is specified at
construction. The class tracks which button is selected.

We've provided a code skeleton in
[RadioButtonGroup.java](RadioButtonGroup.java). Implement all methods that
have been provided. Add class attributes and helper methods as needed, but
do not change any of the provided method signatures.

Your implementation should raise `RuntimeException` on invalid input, as 
specified in the methods' JavaDoc comments.

Feel free to add a `main()` method to test the logic, if you wish.
