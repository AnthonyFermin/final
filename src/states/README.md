# U.S. States

Count U.S. states by the first letters of their names. For example, there are
eight states whose names begin with 'N'.

In [USStates.java](USStates.java), you're provided with a string array with 50
elements, the names of the 50 U.S. states.  Your task is to implement
`countStatesByFirstLetter()`. This method uses the `STATE_NAMES` array and
constructs a map whose keys are the 26 capital letters of the alphabet, and
whose values are the numbers of states with that first letter.
